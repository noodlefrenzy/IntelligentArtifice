This blog is the ramblings of Michael Lanzetta - sometimes on software
development, sometimes on video games, occasionally on other topics. I'm
currently a software developer at Microsoft, but have worked in the past
at Amazon, and other smaller companies (Accelrys, Talus/Manugistics,
Ultima Interconnect Technologies). For the past several years, I've been
working on large-scale distributed systems primarily in the middle-tier,
but I have an abiding interest in systems programming, machine learning,
and general software development practices. I'm constantly seeking ways
to improve myself as a programmer, and I find that programming in a
variety of languages is one of those - broadening perspectives and
making you consider the implicit constraints inherent in your day-to-day
language of choice.

Notes on the blog: In some of my posts, I've included links to products
on Amazon (typically books). These include my affiliates ID - all money
I make from my Amazon Affiliates account, I just roll over into my
annual donation to the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/).  So if you're
worried about me using this blog as a cash-cow, you can rest easy, but
if you don't want to give to the EFF just remember to remove the
affiliate link before you buy.
