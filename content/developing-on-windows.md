This isn't a long post, I just wanted to shout-out my colleague [Felix
Rieseberg](http://www.felixrieseberg.com/), who has [a great
post](http://www.felixrieseberg.com/the-windows-dev-environment/)outlining
a whole selection of tools to help you get up and running with a Windows
development environment.  The most notable is probably [Chocolatey
NuGet](http://chocolatey.org/), which if you're a long-term Windows user
is just revelatory, and if you're also on Linux and familiar
with `apt-get, `you'll be familiar with.

For getting a set of \*nix tools running in Windows, I think we can all
agree that Cygwin is dead.  He recommends
[GOW](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow) which I've just started playing
around with, but I'm more familiar with
[GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) and would recommend those
(for now) - either one frees you from cygpath-hell.
