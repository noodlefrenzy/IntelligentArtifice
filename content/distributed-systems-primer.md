[Henry Robinson](https://twitter.com/HenryR), the smart Cloudera SDE
behind The [Paper Trail](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/) blog, just
posted a great [primer on distributed
systems](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/distributed-systems-theory-for-the-distributed-systems-engineer/ "Distributed Systems Theory for the Distributed Systems Engineer").
 I highly recommend anyone interested in this field go and take a
look - if you've been around long enough, you'll have read most of the
papers, but it's a good collection of resources.  I also agree with the
person in the comments who recommended
[Raft](http://raftconsensus.github.io/)be included, although I would
include it *in addition to* Paxos, and not *in lieu of* it.
