I've decided to move from [my MSDN
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/milanz/) to my own WordPress site.  No big
deal, since my cobweb of a blog hadn't been updated in years, but you
might notice that this site is much younger than most of the posts on
it.  I've migrated my old posts and back-dated them to their original
publishing date.

My hope is that I'll be publishing to my blog more frequently, and my
plan is to open up the blog to non-programming-related topics in an
effort to motivate myself to make that happen. Hopefully that strategy
works.
